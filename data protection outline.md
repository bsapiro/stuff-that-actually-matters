#The case for making data protection a foundational requirement

_(working title)_

##a software based society
* we are increasingly a software based society (software eats the world argument)
* we rely on software (software on hardware or software in hardware) to run our society
* software runs critical parts of our society from financial systems to electrical grids to manufacturing. Software keeps planes in the sky and keeps us connected (even your old bakelite phone relies on a smart network core to route your call)
* even software that isn't mission critical was become important to its users
* if software fails to work the way we expect, whether by accident or by malicious design, it has impact on its users ranging from mild inconvenience to business disruption to life altering events (cite impact of Russian intelligence activities)
* we aren't just build software, we're building fundamental parts of society
* consider software that has crossed the 1 million user mark, those that have crossed 1 billion. How many users does software need before it is part of society? It could be as little as one user in one important company. 

##user expectations
* users give us their data and expect us to keep it safe, they trust our software and by extension they trust us
* use of data is not a neutral act, sharing of data, even if public, is not a neutral act. Whether that data is shared involuntarily, whether stolen or shared because of a monetization strategy (even if consented too) users feel a betrayal of trust
* if 
* the user expectation:

> I will give you data and expect that you will keep it safe. Protected from unauthorized access; free from corruption and available when I need it. I will give you no room in this matter
