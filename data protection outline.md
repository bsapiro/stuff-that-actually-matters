#The case for making data protection a foundational requirement

_(working title)_

##a software based society
* we are increasingly a software based society (software eats the world argument)
* we rely on software (software on hardware or software in hardware) to run our society
* software runs critical parts of our society from financial systems to electrical grids to manufacturing. Software keeps planes in the sky and keeps us connected (even your old bakelite phone relies on a smart network core to route your call)
* even software that isn't mission critical was become important to its users
* if software fails to work the way we expect, whether by accident or by malicious design, it has impact on its users ranging from mild inconvenience to business disruption to life altering events (cite impact of Russian intelligence activities)
* we aren't just build software, we're building fundamental parts of society
* consider software that has crossed the 1 million user mark, those that have crossed 1 billion. How many users does software need before it is part of society? It could be as little as one user in one important company. 

##user expectations
* users give us their data and expect us to keep it safe, they trust our software and by extension they trust us
* use of data is not a neutral act, sharing of data, even if public, is not a neutral act. Whether that data is shared involuntarily, whether stolen or shared because of a monetization strategy (even if consented too) users feel a betrayal of trust
* if we share data in a way the user does not expect they lose confidence in us
* if that data matters to them in some way then
* the user expectation:

> I will give you data and expect that you will keep it safe. Protected from unauthorized access; free from corruption and available when I need it. I will give you no reprieve in this matter

* 

##as we became connected we relied more on everything around us
* your software relies on third party components, a data centre, other service providers
* to make our software we work we may actually share some or all of the data we collect with someone who transforms it in some useful way
* ...

##getting hacked
* getting hacked - having your data stolen, your systems intruded open by unauthorized access - whatever the actual harm, the act is what we will focus on. The motivation behind a hackers actions is rarely informative until after the fact.
* the old adage about getting hacked is that it's not if but when
* "who would want to hack us" is not a useful line of reasoning
* asymmetry of security - you have to be right the entire time, hacker only has to be right once
* automation - hackers embraced automation long before the software profession discovered devops. Hackers can trivially search the entire internet for a specific class of defect and then abuse it on mass
* in highly automated criminal world, the cost to compromise a single system is approaching zero. You are just a target of opportunity

##why are hacks possible?
* we won't discuss all the means in fact we'll concencrate on concepts alone
* bugs in software - pure implementation flaws, logic errors, design mistakes or intentional ommissions based on ignorance or invalid assumptions
* implementation flaw lack of input validation
* assuming you were operating inside an environment you have exclusive control of
* relying on third parties/components to behave in a consistent manner
* ...

##the smallest unit of data

##privacy and security

##informed consent

##understanding (regulatory) harm
* arguably getting hacked

##the cost of a breach
* investigation
* downtime
* reputation harm
* loss of sales / loss of velocity / loss of users
* cleanup
* fixing broken software
* lawyers (suing you)
* lawyers (keeping you from being sued)
* product recall (if your software is in a tangible thing)
* dealing with regulators (like lawyers but less willing to compromise)

##the lawyers are coming (actually they're already here)

##the citizens are coming

##the internet's alpha predator

##an impossible promise (but one we must make anyways)

##security and privacy at the beginning

##well understood problems 

##well understood solution patterns

##it's a business problem

##responsible disclosure
